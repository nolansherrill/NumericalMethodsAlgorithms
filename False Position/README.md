# False Position
This function uses Matlab and the false position method to formulate an estimate at the root of an equation
The required inputs are the function being analyzed, upper bound, lower bound, relative error, and the maximum number of iterations if desired.
The function outputs are the function value at the root, the root itself, the relative error, and the number of iterations.
